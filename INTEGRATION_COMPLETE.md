## 🎨 Theme Compatibility Fixed

**Problem**: Pages were using hardcoded dark theme colors (`text-white`, `bg-gray-800`) causing visibility issues in light mode.

**Solution**: Replaced all hardcoded colors with theme-aware CSS variables:
- `text-white` → `text-foreground`
- `text-gray-400` → `text-muted-foreground`
- `bg-gray-800` → `bg-card` or `bg-background`
- `border-gray-700` → `border-border`

## 📊 Mock Data Included

Both pages work with comprehensive mock data:

**Compliance Page**:
- 4 regulations with AI summaries
- 3 compliance alerts with action items
- 4 calendar events
- 2 chemical search results

**Network Page**:
- 12 suppliers across Tier 2/3/4
- Locations across India (Tirupur, Ludhiana, Surat, etc.)
- Various certifications (GOTS, OEKO-TEX, ISO, ZDHC)
- Risk scores from 15-85
- Connected supply chain relationships
