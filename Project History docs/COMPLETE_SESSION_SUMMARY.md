## 🚨 CURRENT ISSUE: API Key 401 Errors

### Problem
Backend is running but getting **401 "Invalid API Key"** errors for Groq and OpenRouter.

### Root Cause
**Your API keys are invalid or expired.** The backend configuration is correct and loading the .env file properly, but the API providers are rejecting the keys.

### ✅ SOLUTION (Action Required)

#### Step 1: Get Fresh Groq API Key
1. Go to: https://console.groq.com/keys
2. Sign in to your account
3. Delete any old keys
4. Click "Create API Key"
5. Copy the new key (starts with `gsk_`)

#### Step 2: Update .env File
Open `.env` in the project root and update:
```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_YOUR_NEW_KEY_HERE
```

#### Step 3: Restart Backend
**IMPORTANT:** Stop the backend completely (Ctrl+C) and restart:
```bash
cd backend
python main.py
```

#### Step 4: Test
1. Open frontend: http://localhost:3000
2. Go to Dashboard → Chatbot
3. Send message: "Hello"
4. Should work without 401 errors!
